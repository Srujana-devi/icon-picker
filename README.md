## Icon-Picker
an icon picker component (sample image attached below). The icon picker opens up when a small 100X100 `div` is clicked. The icon picker component should accept the following `props`:

- `rowsInOnePage`
- `columnsInOnePage`
- `iconHeight`
- `iconWidth`
- `pickerHeight` (default = 500px)
- `pickerWidth` (default = 500px)
- On selecting an icon in the icon picker, the icon picker should dismiss and the selected icon should show up in the `div` mentioned earlier.
